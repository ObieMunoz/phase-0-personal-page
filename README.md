<p align="center">This was the first website I truly made from scratch! The vast majority of things on here were learned directly from the pre-work curriculum at Flatiron School. Yes, there were several things I did have to research on my own to figure out; However, I have a feeling that's never going to change with programming. Now that I've got the basics down, I can reference other materials and actually understand them to implement what is described! This project helped me learn quite a bit and I'm happy with the result.</p>
