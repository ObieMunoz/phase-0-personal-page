                    <h2>BIOGRAPHY</h2>
                </div>
                <p> I was born and raised in Tampa, Florida, and went to a military school in St. Petersburg, Florida,
                    called
                    Admiral Farragut Academy. Although neither of my parents were in the military, as a child I was
                    fascinated
                    by those who chose such a career path. I thoroughly enjoyed my time at this school and feel it created a great
                    foundation for who I am today. After I graduated from high school, I decided to stay local to the
                    Tampa
                    Bay,
                    Florida, area and attended college at the University of South Florida.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During college, I bounced around several different areas of study until I ended with a Bachelor's
                    degree
                    in
                    Criminology. I did not grow up wanting to learn about criminal behavior and I had no dreams of
                    becoming
                    a
                    police officer. If I'm being honest, I was pretty lazy during college and I found that this was the
                    easiest
                    degree I could actually obtain. That being said, during my senior year of college, I completed an
                    internship
                    with a local sheriff's office. Who knew? Something I had never considered possible before happened:
                    I
                    chose
                    to make a career out of it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since that time, I have spent my adult life over the past 10 years serving my local community as a law enforcement officer.
                    After
                    being hired, I received successive promotions and eventually became a Financial Crimes Detective.
                    Over
                    time,
                    I investigated and managed an average of 26 cases simultaneously, primarily focusing on all forms of
                    fraud
                    including credit card and wire-transfer, the criminal use of personal identification information,
                    financial exploitation of the elderly, business e-mail compromise
                    scams,
                    and miscellaneous other financial offenses.

                    Although I enjoyed the majority of my law enforcement career, in 2021 and after a decade of service, I decided I was ready to
                    focus on
                    a
                    new journey. I resigned from law enforcement in May, 2021, and began learning to code in my
                    free
                    time. I started out by learning Python using free resources such as <a
                    href="http://www.pythonprinciples.com">Python Principles</a> and <a
                    href="https://www.youtube.com">YouTube</a>. While teaching myself as much as I could, I referenced many documentation websites and
                    eventually completed a small amount of coursework on <a href="https://www.udemy.com">Udemy</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Eventually, I realized I wanted more. I wanted to learn to code at a faster pace than I could teach myself for free online so I began researching coding bootcamps and eventually found <a
                        href="https://www.flatironschool.com">Flatiron
                        School</a>! I was impressed by what I heard after speaking with admissions and decided to take a
                        leap,
                        joining the cohort beginning on November 1, 2021!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After completing my pre-work requirements early, Flatiron staff reached out to me and asked if I would like
                        to join the cohort that begins on October 11, 2021. There's no time like the present, so I accepted. I know my new
                    career is waiting and I can't wait to have it within reach!
                   </p>
