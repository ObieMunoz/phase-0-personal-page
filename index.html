                    I have spent my entire adult life serving my local community as a law enforcement officer. After being hired, I received successive promotions and eventually became a Financial Crimes Detective. I investigated and managed an average of 26 cases simultaneously, primarily focusing on all forms of fraud including credit card and wire-transfer, the criminal use of personal identification information, counterfeits including currency, financial exploitation of the elderly, business e-mail compromise scams, and miscellaneous other financial offenses.

                    I began researching coding bootcamps and eventually found <a href="https://www.flatironschool.com">Flatiron School</a>! I was impressed by what I heard after speaking with admissions and decided to take a leap, joining the cohort beginning on November 1, 2021! <br><br><br><br>I'm looking forward to continuing this journey and entering a whole new career in the world of coding!

                    In 2021, I decided I was ready to focus on a new journey. I resigned from law enforcement service in May, 2021, and began learning to code in my free time. I began by learning Python using free resources such as <a href="https://www.pythonprinciples.com">Python Principles</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com">YouTube</a>. I referenced many documentation websites and eventually completed a small amount of coursework on <a href="https://www.udemy.com">Udemy</a>.
